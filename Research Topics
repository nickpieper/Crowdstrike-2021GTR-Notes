Ransomware families and their differences:
  * Maze (Twisted Spider)
  * Conti (Wizard Spider)
  * Netwalker
  * Revil (Pinchy Spider)
  * Ryuk (Wizard Spider)
  * DopplePaymer
  * Egregor (Twisted Spider)
  * Pysa
  * Defray777
  * Clop
  * LockBit
  * MedusaLocker (used by Anthropoid Spider)
  * Nemty X
  * RagnarLocker
  * Awaddon
  * Ekans
  * MountLocker
  * SunCrypt
  --------------
  * DarkSide (Carbon Spider)
These families above the line are in order of confirmed healthcare sector deployments in 2020 (via CS)

Key points (not related to any countries):

* eCrime has gained 10% YoY versus targeted intrusion groups. These groups are denoted with the "SPIDER" naming convention.
* COVID19 brought healthcare into the spotlight within these groups. Some adversaries used COVID-19 themes in lures, while some outright targeted the healthcare/govt response sector.
* eCrime groups are broadening their operational focuses from a specific veritcal to multiple sectors/verticles to hit big game. (ex Graceful Spider when from targeted eCrime to launching their own RaaS operation. Carbon Spider shifting away from PoS campaigns and developing DarkSide.)
* DLSs (data leak sites) are incresingly becoming common by ransomware operators. This combines the detremental aspects of file encryption with data leakage to maximize corporate payouts.
* While DLS/data leaks grew, the way it was done is different among groups. Some groups do releases with a percentage of data while others release in numbered parts.
  - Carbon Spider uses an automated system to release data.
  - Releasing data by type is also done (Viking Spider, Pinchy Spider)
* Industrial/Engineering & Manufacturing were hit the hardest with data leaks in 2020.
* Access brokers selling entry into networks was a notable 2020 addition to the report (Lunar Spider and Mallard Spider use their capabilities to do this)
